# Product Transparency Portal

A full-stack web application designed to promote transparency, trust, and health-first product decisions.

## Project Overview

The Product Transparency Portal allows companies to submit detailed information about their products, which is then processed to generate comprehensive transparency reports. The application uses AI to generate intelligent follow-up questions based on initial product information, creating a more thorough and meaningful transparency assessment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI Microservice**: FastAPI (Python)

## Features

- Landing page with mission statement and call-to-action
- Multi-step product submission form with conditional logic
- Intelligent follow-up questions generated by AI
- PDF report generation and download
- Responsive and accessible design
- (Optional) User authentication system for companies

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Set up your PostgreSQL database
# Update .env file with your database credentials
npm start
```

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:5000

### AI Microservice Setup

```bash
cd ai-service
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The AI service will be available at http://localhost:8000

## API Endpoints

### Backend Endpoints

- `POST /api/products` - Save product data
- `GET /api/report/:id` - Fetch product data and return PDF

### AI Service Endpoints

- `POST /generate-questions` - Generate follow-up questions based on product information
- `POST /transparency-score` - (Optional) Calculate transparency score for a product

## Sample Product Input

```json
{
  "name": "Organic Multivitamin",
  "description": "Daily multivitamin made with organic ingredients",
  "category": "Supplements",
  "ingredients": ["Vitamin C", "Vitamin D", "Zinc", "Organic Fruit Blend"],
  "manufacturing_location": "USA",
  "certifications": ["USDA Organic", "Non-GMO Project Verified"]
}
```

## Reflection on AI and Transparency Design Principles

In developing the Product Transparency Portal, we've embraced AI as a tool to enhance transparency rather than obscure it. By using AI to generate contextually relevant follow-up questions, we create a more thorough and meaningful transparency assessment that adapts to each product's unique characteristics. This approach acknowledges that transparency isn't one-size-fits-allâ€”different products require different types of disclosure.

Our design principles center on making transparency accessible and actionable. Rather than overwhelming consumers with technical jargon or excessive information, we focus on presenting transparency data in a clear, structured format that highlights what matters most. The PDF reports are designed to be both comprehensive for those who want details and scannable for those seeking quick insights.

Ultimately, this project represents our belief that technology should serve to illuminate rather than complicate, empowering both companies to communicate their values and consumers to make informed, health-conscious decisions.
